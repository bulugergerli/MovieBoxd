# Database Project

## Starting the Web Application

### Frontend Only
Make sure you have [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, and working on the ./frontend/ directory.
#### Use the following command to download neccessary dependancies for Vue frontend:
```sh
npm install
```
#### Compile and hot-reload for frontend
```sh
npm run dev
```
#### Compile and build for frontend (required for [Frontend+Backend](#frontend--backend-backend-only))
```sh
npm run build
```
This command generated all the frontend to compiled assets. It makes it possible to host a web server with just these files alone. [Frontend+Backend](#frontend--backend-backend-only) serves these build files alongside the backend.
#### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```

### Frontend + Backend (Backend Only)

#### To start the web appliaction with the static build files generated by Vue alongside the backend, make sure you have [Go](https://go.dev/) 1.18 or higher installed, and run:
```sh
go run main.go
```
With this way, the backend API will start routing its own routes, and also serve static build files generated by Vue on the /frontend/dist/ directory. If there is no build files in that directory, you will get a 404, but you are still able to work with backend only.

### Backend Live Server
First, we are going to install air.

```sh
go install github.com/cosmtrek/air@latest
```
Next, we need to configure Air for our Golang project. You can do that by running the following command:
```sh
air init
```
This will create a air.toml file that will contain the default configurations for Air. Here is an example of what that looks like:
```sh
root = "."
testdata_dir = "testdata"
tmp_dir = "tmp"

[build]
  bin = "./tmp/main"
  cmd = "go build -o ./tmp/main ."
  delay = 1000
  exclude_dir = ["assets", "tmp", "vendor", "testdata"]
  exclude_file = []
  exclude_regex = ["_test.go"]
  exclude_unchanged = false
  follow_symlink = false
  full_bin = ""
  include_dir = []
  include_ext = ["go", "tpl", "tmpl", "html"]
  kill_delay = "0s"
  log = "build-errors.log"
  send_interrupt = false
  stop_on_error = true

[color]
  app = ""
  build = "yellow"
  main = "magenta"
  runner = "green"
  watcher = "cyan"

[log]
  time = false

[misc]
  clean_on_exit = false

[screen]
  clear_on_rebuild = false
```
Next, let me highlight a few notable configurations you might care about and might want to update for your project.

Under build in the air.toml; you might want to change the cmd property. If the entry of your golang application is in a different directory, say server, you can change the property to something like this:
```sh
cmd = "go build -o ./tmp/main ./server/main.go"
```
Finally, the only part that is remaining is running our Golang application using Air. You can do this by running the air command:
```sh
air
```
