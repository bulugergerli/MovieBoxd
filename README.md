# Database Project

## Starting the Web Application

### Frontend Only
Make sure you have [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, and working on the ./frontend/ directory.
#### Use the following command to download neccessary dependancies for Vue frontend:
```sh
npm install
```
#### Compile and hot-reload for frontend
```sh
npm run dev
```
#### Compile and build for frontend (required for [Frontend+Backend](#frontend--backend-backend-only))
```sh
npm run build
```
This command generated all the frontend to compiled assets. It makes it possible to host a web server with just these files alone. [Frontend+Backend](#frontend--backend-backend-only) serves these build files alongside the backend.
#### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```

### Frontend + Backend (Backend Only)

#### To start the web appliaction with the static build files generated by Vue alongside the backend, make sure you have [Go](https://go.dev/) 1.18 or higher installed, and run:
```sh
go run main.go
```
With this way, the backend API will start routing its own routes, and also serve static build files generated by Vue on the /frontend/dist/ directory. If there is no build files in that directory, you will get a 404, but you are still able to work with backend only.
